This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's app directory. When using middleware with dynamic routes, accessing the `params` object can return `undefined`, leading to application errors. The solution involves ensuring the middleware function has proper access to the request and its properties before accessing the `params` object, possibly by utilizing a custom `Request` handling approach or moving the logic which depends on the parameter value to the page itself.
